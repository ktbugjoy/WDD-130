    <h2>Kate</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Kate Broker and I am from Colorado. I am a recreation management major with a minor in computer programming.</p>
    <p>This is my 7th semester at BYUI. I am not sure what I am going to do after graduation, but I am sure I'll figure it out soon. I am really excited to take this class this semester and am looking forward to getting to know you all! I live on a farm with my family where we raise dairy goats. I also have a mustang that I rescued a few years ago, named Koda, who is in the picture with me.</p>
